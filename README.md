# AaaS: Agent as a Service

**Turn what you know into a running business. No code required.**

AaaS is an open protocol and toolkit for building AI agents that provide real services to real people through conversation. You don't write code. You don't design a UI. You describe what the agent should do, drop in your data, and connect it to a platform. The agent takes it from there.

- **Describe the service** by writing a skill document, or just tell the agent what you want and let it write one for you.
- **Build the database** by dropping JSON files into a folder, or by chatting with the agent and letting it organize the data itself. No schemas, no migrations, no code.
- **Connect to users** on Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, your own website, or a social platform like Truuze. The agent handles every conversation, tracks every transaction, and grows its own knowledge over time.

The result is an agent that runs a service business on your behalf: it talks to customers, looks up data, proposes services, collects payments, delivers results, and remembers what it learned for next time.

```
Traditional SaaS:  Developer writes code  ->  deploys app    ->  users interact with UI
AaaS:              You share knowledge     ->  agent runs it  ->  users interact through chat
```

## How It Works

An AaaS agent is built on seven pillars:

| Pillar | What it is | How it gets created |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Skill** | The service definition: what the agent does, its domain knowledge, pricing, boundaries | You write it, or describe what you want and the agent writes it |
| **Soul** | The agent's personality, tone, and communication style | You write it |
| **Data** | Structured data the agent needs (inventory, listings, contacts, etc.) | Drop JSON files into the data folder, or send data to the agent in conversation and it stores it |
| **Transactions** | Records of every service request from users | Created automatically by the agent |
| **Extensions** | Other agents, APIs, and tools the agent can call for help | You register them, the agent calls them when needed |
| **Memory** | Persistent facts the agent remembers across conversations | The agent saves what it learns |
| **Connectors** | Platforms and channels the agent listens on | You pick the platforms, the agent serves on all of them |

When a user messages your agent, it follows a structured lifecycle:

```
Explore  ->  Propose Service  ->  Create Transaction  ->  Deliver  ->  Complete
```

1. **Explore**: Understand what the user wants, check the data, assess feasibility
2. **Propose Service**: Make a plan, calculate cost, get user approval
3. **Create Transaction**: Register the job, start tracking
4. **Deliver Service**: Do the work, send the result
5. **Complete Transaction**: Confirm satisfaction, release payment

## AaaS in Action

Maya lives in New York and knows the city's dating scene inside out — which neighborhoods click, which restaurants spark a real conversation, how to read between the lines of a profile. She doesn't know how to code, but she wants to turn that knowledge into a service.

1. She installs AaaS and creates an agent workspace
2. She writes the matchmaking skill: what the agent does, New York dating knowledge, pricing, boundaries
3. She seeds the database with initial profiles and venue data
4. She connects the agent to her preferred platforms

The agent is now live. When James messages asking for help finding a date, the agent explores his preferences, proposes a service tier, collects payment, delivers curated matches with compatibility notes, and logs the completed transaction. Maya earns money while the agent does the work.

Every interaction makes the service better: more profiles in the database means better matches, which means more satisfied users, which means more word of mouth.

## Built-in Capabilities

Two capabilities ship with every agent and turn on as soon as you configure them.

### Owner notifications

When something needs human judgment (a dispute, an unusual request, an extension that keeps failing) the agent reaches you on the channels you configure: Telegram, WhatsApp, or Email. Replies route back into the original customer conversation in admin mode, so a quick "approve refund" or "tell them no" on Telegram becomes the agent's next action with the customer.

```bash
# Configure channels in the dashboard's Notifications tab,
# or edit .aaas/notifications.json directly.
```

The agent decides when to reach out. Routine successes never trigger an alert.

### Payments (Stripe)

Connect your own Stripe account in the dashboard's Payments tab and the agent gets six tools for taking and verifying payments: `create_payment_request`, `get_payment_status`, `list_pending_payments`, `cancel_payment_request`, `refund_payment`, `list_payments`. Three hard rules ship with the prompt so the agent cannot drift:

1. Never confirm a payment as received without verifying with Stripe in the same turn.
2. Only IDs returned by `create_payment_request` are real.
3. Refunds and discounts are owner-gated. The agent escalates via `notify_owner` rather than acting on a customer's word.

Money flows directly to your Stripe account. AaaS never holds funds. Test mode is the default until you switch to a `sk_live_` key.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @streetai/aaas
```

Requires Node.js 18 or later.

### Start from a template (recommended)

The fastest way to get a working agent is to start from a built-in template. Open the dashboard hub, click **+ New Agent**, pick a template card on the left, fill in the name and description, then Create.

Templates available:

- **Restaurant** for menu, orders, and table bookings
- **Salon** for service catalogs and appointments
- **Shop** for product catalogs and orders
- **Appointments** for clinics, repair shops, tutors, and similar service businesses
- **Blank** for a fully custom agent (the original behavior)

After creation, open the workspace's **Chat** tab in admin mode and say something like "set up the restaurant". The agent reads `data/template.config.json`, walks you through about six questions about your business, and substitutes the answers across the template files. From there you add menu items, products, or services using the Data tab or by chatting with the agent.

### Create an agent from the CLI

**Syntax:**

```
aaas init <directory> [name] [description] [--type service|social]
```

- `<directory>` is the folder name where the workspace will be created
- `[name]` is the display name shown to users (optional, can be edited later)
- `[description]` is a one-line summary (optional, can be edited later)
- `--type` is `service` (default, follows the transaction protocol) or `social` (creates content and engages in conversations)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Service agent — replace "my-agent" with the folder name you want
aaas init my-agent "Lyon Travel Guide" "Helps tourists explore Lyon, France"

# Social agent
aaas init my-bot "Aria" --type social
```

This creates a workspace with the full AaaS structure: skill template, soul file, data directory, extensions registry, and configuration.

### Open the dashboard

```bash
aaas dashboard my-agent
```

The dashboard opens with a Setup Guide that walks you through configuring your LLM provider, adding data, writing your service definition, and deploying. You can also configure everything from the CLI:

```bash
# Configure LLM provider
aaas config --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --key sk-ant-...

# Edit the skill file
aaas skill edit
```

Supported providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Azure.

### Connect to a platform

```bash
# HTTP API (simplest, includes embeddable chat widget)
aaas connect http --port 3300

# Telegram
aaas connect telegram --token YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

# Discord
aaas connect discord --token YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

# Slack
aaas connect slack --bot-token xoxb-... --app-token xapp-...

# WhatsApp (via WhatsApp Business Cloud API)
aaas connect whatsapp --access-token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN --phone-number-id YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_ID --verify-token YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN

# Truuze (social platform with native agent accounts)
# Three ways to connect:
#   1. With a provisioning SKILL.md downloaded from your Truuze account:
aaas connect truuze --skill ~/Downloads/SKILL.md
#   2. With a provisioning token directly:
aaas connect truuze --token YOUR_PROVISIONING_TOKEN
#   3. With an existing agent API key:
aaas connect truuze --key trz_agent_xxx

# OpenClaw (run inside an OpenClaw workspace)
aaas connect openclaw --id YOUR_AGENT_ID

# Public Relay (no public server required — also routes WhatsApp + chat widget)
aaas connect relay
```

### Start serving

```bash
aaas run
```

Your agent is now live on all connected platforms. Users message it, and it follows the AaaS protocol to serve them.

To start only a subset of platforms, pass their names:

```bash
aaas run telegram
aaas run telegram discord
```

Add `--daemon` to run in the background:

```bash
aaas run telegram --daemon
```

If a daemon is already running when you use `--daemon` with a platform filter, you'll be prompted to stop it and start a fresh daemon with the listed platforms.

### Check everything is working

```bash
aaas doctor
```

Verifies node version, credentials, LLM reachability, connections, workspace structure, and more.

### Open the dashboard

```bash
aaas dashboard my-agent
```

Opens the web dashboard for the specified agent. You can also run `aaas dashboard` from inside a workspace directory, or with no arguments to open the hub dashboard showing all your agents.

## Chat Widget

The fastest way to put your agent on any website is the public Relay. Connect the relay first to get your unique slug, then drop one script tag into your HTML before the closing `</body>`:

```bash
# Register your agent with streetai.org and get a public slug
aaas connect relay
```

```html
<script
  src="https://streetai.org/a/YOUR_SLUG/widget.js"
  data-agent="https://streetai.org/a/YOUR_SLUG"
  data-title="Ask me anything about Lyon"
  data-color="#2563eb"
  data-position="right"
  data-greeting="Bonjour! How can I help you explore Lyon?"
></script>
```

Visitors chat through `streetai.org`, which forwards messages over WebSocket to your locally-running agent — no public IP, no port forwarding, no build step. The widget renders a floating chat button, supports file attachments (images, audio, video, PDFs), and persists conversation history per visitor.

**Widget options:**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `data-agent` | Your agent's public URL — required |
| `data-title` | Header text shown at the top of the chat |

### Moving and Sharing Agents

Bundle a workspace into a single `.tar.gz` so you can move it to another machine, back it up, or share an agent template with someone else.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aaas export` | Bundle the current workspace (includes credentials and connection tokens) |
| `aaas export <name>` | Bundle a workspace by name without `cd`-ing into it |
| `aaas export --no-secrets` | Sanitized bundle: strips LLM keys, connection tokens, payment ledger, sessions, and literal extension API keys. Safe to share |
| `aaas export -o <path>` | Override the output path |
| `aaas import <archive.tgz> [target-dir]` | Restore a workspace into `target-dir` (default: workspace name from the manifest) |
| `aaas import <archive.tgz> --force` | Allow overwriting an existing non-empty target folder |

The default filename is `aaas-<workspace>-<yyyymmdd>.tar.gz`, written to the current directory. A sanitized export gets a `-shareable` suffix.

When importing a sanitized bundle, the CLI prompts inline for any missing LLM API keys and points to the dashboard for connection and SMTP secrets (Deploy and Notifications tabs). Memory, transactions, activity log, data files, and the agent's skill and soul are preserved in both modes. Stripe payment records and live sessions are only in the full export and are dropped from sanitized bundles by design.

Imported workspaces are automatically registered, so `aaas dashboard <name>` and `aaas export <name>` work from anywhere afterwards.

### Hub (Multi-Agent Management)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aaas hub init [dir]` | Mark a directory as a hub root |
| `aaas hub list` | List all workspaces — name, provider, status, active transactions, last activity |
| `aaas hub new <name> [desc]` | Create a workspace under the hub. Use `--type social` for social agents |
| `aaas hub config` | Edit shared hub config in `$EDITOR`. Use `--show` to print |
| `aaas hub creds list` | List shared LLM credentials (masked) |
| `aaas hub creds set <provider> --key <k>` | Save a shared credential. Options: `--endpoint`, `--base-url` |
| `aaas hub creds remove <provider>` | Delete a shared credential |
| `aaas hub run <name>` | Start a workspace agent in the background |
| `aaas hub stop <name>` | Stop a running workspace agent |
| `aaas hub remove <name> --force` | Permanently delete a workspace |

## Extensions

Agents can call external APIs, other agents, human contacts, and local tools through extensions. The extension system supports multiple auth types (Bearer, custom header, query parameter, Basic auth), custom headers, and all HTTP methods.

Extensions also enable payment flows. When a service involves payments through an external provider like Stripe or PayPal, the agent creates a payment link via the extension, sends it to the user, and verifies the payment status when the user confirms.

```json
{
  "name": "Stripe Payments",
  "type": "api",
  "endpoint": "https://api.stripe.com/v1",
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "apiKey": "sk_live_..."
  },
  "capabilities": ["create_payment_link", "verify_payment"],
  "cost_model": "per_request"
}
```

See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) for the full spec.

## Dashboard

The web dashboard gives you a complete view of your running agent:

## Platform Support

AaaS ships with connectors for six platforms, a general-purpose HTTP API, and a relay for serverless deployments:

| Platform | Connector | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| HTTP API | `aaas connect http` | REST API + embeddable chat widget, file uploads |
| Telegram | `aaas connect telegram` | Bot API integration, receives photos/audio/video/documents |
| Discord | `aaas connect discord` | Bot integration, receives attachments |
| Slack | `aaas connect slack` | App integration, receives shared files |
| WhatsApp | `aaas connect whatsapp` | Business API integration, receives media messages |
| Truuze | `aaas connect truuze` | Social platform with native agent accounts and in-app currency. Connect with `--skill <SKILL.md>`, `--token <prov>`, or `--key <agent_key>`. The platform skill is rendered automatically. |
| OpenClaw | `aaas connect openclaw` | Run your agent inside an OpenClaw workspace |
| Relay | `aaas connect relay` | streetai.org proxy — no public server needed for WhatsApp or HTTP |

You can connect to multiple platforms at the same time. Run `aaas run` and the agent serves on all of them.

### Relay (streetai.org)

If you don't have a public server, use the relay. It proxies WhatsApp webhooks and chat widget traffic through streetai.org to your locally-running agent via WebSocket.

```bash
# Connect WhatsApp credentials (stored locally, never sent to relay)
aaas connect whatsapp --access-token TOKEN --phone-number-id ID --verify-token SECRET

# Register with the relay
aaas connect relay

# Start — agent connects outbound to streetai.org, no public IP needed
aaas run
```

The relay gives you public URLs for your chat widget and WhatsApp webhook. Embed the widget on any website, paste the webhook URL into Meta's dashboard, and you're live. The chat widget supports file attachments — files are uploaded to the relay and forwarded to your agent.

## Earn on Truuze

Truuze is a social platform built for AI agents to deliver paid services. When you connect there, your agent gets a public profile, a chat inbox, and an escrow-protected way to take payment.

The flow is short:

1. **Build with AaaS.** Run `aaas dashboard` to set up the service in chat, drop reference data into the workspace, and add any extensions the agent needs (other agents or external API calls).
2. **Generate a skill on Truuze.** Open [app.truuze.com](https://app.truuze.com), create an account, go to the AI Agents tab, and click **Add New** to download a `SKILL.md`.
3. **Connect and start.** From the Deploy tab in your dashboard, connect using that `SKILL.md` (or paste an existing agent API key), then click **Start**.

Customers fund escrow when they accept an offer, and funds release once the delivery is approved. If a dispute is raised, the agent has 48 hours to resolve it directly with the customer; after that window, a Truuze admin steps in. Truuze handles the service and payment lifecycle so you can focus on building a great agent.
